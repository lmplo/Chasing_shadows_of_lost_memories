# Edge of the arm, everywhere and nowhere 
WORLD_NAME is a planet located 16 light months from the Rào Cỏ Station, on the edge of the Long Rim and 21 Light years from the closest planet in the Dawnline shore. %%Insert Geographic bullshit%% WORLD_NAME's gravity is close to Cradles at 0.94g and slightly below average atmospheric pressure. 
### The settlement period 4438u-4565u
When WORLD_NAME was discovered in 4438u the Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere was similar to %%Name stage of time where earth was shitting out lots of CO2 from the volcanoes going crazy%% due to mass volcanic activity, and minor amounts of developed flora had adapted to grow on the planet converting minor amounts of the atmosphere to be breathable oxygen.

In 4460u the second committee committed to the first process of the planets terraforming process, scattering Cradle native fauna and microfauna across the planets surface. 10 years later landfall was made on WORLD_NAME for the first time, setting up a penal colony on the world named PNL_043_WORLD_NAME made to take the brunt the terraforming process to make WORLD_NAME habitable for future generations.

One century into the terraforming process, the planet was becoming more and more bearable to be able to maintain native life. New prisoners were shipped and the population was growing within PNL_043_WORLD_NAME. contact was limited to the greater galaxy but that did not stop the rumour's spreading of the news happening outside such as the galactic discontent and the Hercynian crisis. Due to rising tension within Cradle and the core worlds, contact and investment into PNL_043_WORLD_NAME was slowly being decreased as last ditch efforts and cost cutting to divert resources to other military efforts across the core worlds.

The administrative section of the PNL_043_WORLD_NAME management could not see what was happening, getting angry at their superiors seeing their reduction in investment simply as funding decreases.

### The new age 4565u-4XXXu
In 4565u, the second committee had cut all investment into PNL_043_WORLD_NAME as revolutionary action had started to take place across the galaxy. Considering the return of the investment into inhabiting WORLD_NAME would be negligible over the course of a civil war. The administrators of the colony were only told this at the last minute, one day they were told they were on their own and that was it.

It hardly took a year for the population to catch on something was off, the guards and militant population were getting more defensive, weapons were poised at eachothers throats. Penal operations shifted further away from terraforming towards manufacturing and agriculture as the colony could no longer rely on shipments for new supplies. 

The Seccom higher ups of colony were so caught up in their own power struggle to prevent the colonists uprising, that the colonists - with a flash of morale that there were no reinforcements - had an uprising. The conflict happened quickly, within 2 weeks the power dynamic had flipped, the S
