The Gandal system is located 16 light months from the Rào Cỏ Station, on the edge of the Long Rim and 21 Light years from the closest planet in the Dawnline shore. The Gandal system only has 3 planets, inclduding Pawal. %%Insert Geographic bullshit%% Pawal's gravity is close to Cradles at 0.94g and slightly below average atmospheric pressure. 
### The settlement period 4438u-4565u
When the G4D41 was discovered in 4438u, a near habitable planet was identified, G4D41-02, the Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere was similar to %%Name stage of time where earth was shitting out lots of CO2 from the volcanoes going crazy%% due to mass volcanic activity, and minor amounts of developed flora had adapted to grow on the planet converting minor amounts of the atmosphere to be breathable oxygen.

In 4460u the second committee committed to the first process of the planets terraforming process, scattering Cradle native fauna and microfauna across the planets surface. 10 years later landfall was made on G4D41-02 for the first time, setting up a penal colony on the world named PNL_043_G4D41-02 made to take the brunt the terraforming process to make G4D41-02 habitable for future generations.

One century into the terraforming process, the planet was becoming more and more bearable to be able to maintain native life. New prisoners were shipped and the population was growing within PNL_043_G4D41-02. contact was limited to the greater galaxy but that did not stop the rumour's spreading of the news happening outside such as the galactic discontent and the Hercynian crisis. Due to rising tension within Cradle and the core worlds, contact and investment into PNL_043_G4D41-02 was slowly being decreased as last ditch efforts and cost cutting to divert resources to other military efforts across the core worlds.

The administrative section of the PNL_043_G4D41-02 management could not see what was happening, getting angry at their superiors seeing their reduction in investment simply as funding decreases.

### The new age 4565u-4852u
In 4565u, the second committee had cut all investment into PNL_043_G4D41-02 as revolutionary action had started to take place across the galaxy. Considering the return of the investment into inhabiting G4D41-02 would be negligible over the course of a galactic civil war. The administrators of the colony were only told this at the last minute, one day they were told they were on their own and that was it.

It hardly took a year for the population to catch on something was off, the guards and militant population were getting more defensive, weapons were poised at each others throats. Penal operations shifted further away from terraforming towards manufacturing and agriculture as the colony could no longer rely on shipments for new supplies. 

The Seccom higher ups of colony were so caught up in their own power struggle to prevent the colonists uprising, that the colonists - with a flash of morale that there were no reinforcements - had an uprising. The conflict happened quickly, within 2 weeks the power dynamic had flipped, the Second committee remnants of the colony had either been killed, executed or imprisoned.

The next decades were harsh, the colony had freed themselves from the grasp of the second committee but still had to continue their work of terraforming to survive. The planet was only partially habitable and they no longer had any form of shipments to bring them new supplies to the colony, they were on their own.

Further centuries past and culture changed, the people of the terraforming process was closer to completion, as it reached this point the people of PNL_043_G4D41-02 had named their system and planet as culture developed and changed the system was now locally known as Gandal, and planet as Pawan. which had been renamed to CAPITAL_COLONY_NAME had been split off, mining outposts had become mining towns, large storage areas had become trading posts and their own independent colonies, the people of Pawan had began to spread out across the planet.

One main industry that Pawan produced in bulk was amounts of weaponry manufacturing, anti-orbital weapons, automated aerial defences, defensive positions and personnel defense weapons for colony garrisons. From the perspective of Pawan, Union will return in force, they had taken a colony and those oppressive rulers that banished their ancestors to this once so desolate place on the edge of the galaxy... But for centuries no one came, no contact was made. Great rusting hulks that had been forzen over, raised to strike the empty skies of Pawan. Until 4852u, when Union returned. 

### The recontact 4852u-5016u (now)
Once dormant anti-orbital weaponry pinged a contact into the solar system, a Union probe. The people of Pawan scrambled to get their neglected weapon systems back into working order, there was a war they were ready to fight whilst being heavily outgunned. Ancient myth had turned to be true, global panic and mobilisation was underway, until Union contacted Pawan.

Union stated their intentions of peace, they weren't the old oppressors and the system of G4D41 had only just been rediscovered. Inviting the people of Pawan to talks for integration into Union. The people of Pawan took a hard stance and declined, and so after weeks of back and forth communication, Union left.

Just like that they were gone, the people of Pawan had began mobilising their weapons and, they had left... Did Union *actually* mean it? Was this their method of goading the people into a false sense of security? Will the battle ships arrive soon shortly after? Either way, the decision of the people was that Union left this colony to rot, so they will never consort with Union.

The rediscovery of the system however opened them up to the rest of the galaxy, Gandal was now known and had been discovered which allowed Enterprises and companies to reach out to Pawal as well, along side pirates and various refugees. As much as Pawal wished to stay under the radar and isolationist, their gates had been opened against their choice.

They started with a stance against all outside the system, but Gandal was a comfortable spot on the border of the Long Rim with enough of a population that pirates could hide among the population, but barren enough that they could inhabit anywhere far from civilisation they wished, enterprises would ask to establish trading outposts. The people of Pawan wanted to stay isolated but unfortunately they had little choice, they needed outside help. They shifted the line on where they standed with outsiders, moving from fully isolationist to accepting some help. This would be the best and worst decision the people of Pawan had made.

The past few years places Pawan in the situation it is currently in now, the PAWAN_PEOPLE_FACTION have made deals with various enterprises and companies along with defense contracts to protect against piracy, bolstering their trade, culture and survivability on the Gandal. However, due to the PAWAN_PEOPLE_FACTION's hard anti-Union stance it opens them up to exploitation, they can only rely on themselves to guarantee their land isn't taken from themselves, companies and enterprises are trading to and from Pawan, deliveries coincidentally "getting lost" as it is used as a halfway point to trade Union contraband into and out of the Long Rim.
