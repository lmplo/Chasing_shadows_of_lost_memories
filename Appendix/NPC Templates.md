## Aerial
*The capability for mechs to fly has always been impractical. But the foolhardy and stubborn pilots will always find a way to get their rig to reach heights that should only be achieved by falling from orbit.*

### TEMPLATE FEATURES
#### MAKESHIFT FLIGHT SYSTEMS
*Trait*
The **Aerial** may choose **optional systems** and traits from the **Aerial systems and traits list**. Additionally it may choose one Flight system from the **Flight system list**. All of these flight systems do not prevent the character from being slowed in 0g environments or underwater.

#### VULNERABLE FLIGHT LINKAGE
*Trait*
All hostile characters gain an additional **invade** option when targeting the **Aerial****:** “The **Aerial** is forced to land if they are flying, and the **Aerial** cannot fly until the end of their next turn.” All characters are aware of this trait.

### FLIGHT SYSTEMS
#### JUMP BOOSTERS
*System*
The **Aerial** may **fly** when they **boost**; however, they must end the movement a solid surface or immediately begin falling.

#### TYPE-1 FLIGHT SYSTEM
*System*
The **Aerial** may choose to count any and all of their movement as **flying**; however, they take **Size + 1 heat** at the end of any turns in which they **fly** this way.

#### ROTARY BLADES
The **Aerial** may hover when it moves; however, they take **Size + 1 heat** at the end of any turns in which they **fly** this way.

Additionally whenever the **Aerial** takes damage whilst **hovering**, they must make an engineering check. On a failure, this system is immediately destroyed and Airborne begins to fall.

%%Balance this to be a better cost, save on damage is probs a tad too fragile.%%

### AERIAL SYSTEM AND TRAITS
#### DIVE BOMB
*Trait, Free action, 1/round*
As a free action whilst **flying**, the **Aerial** may immediately begin falling. The **Aerial** may make melee attacks whilst falling. If they hit, the **Aerial** takes no fall damage from falling and instead deals **bonus damage** equal to half the distance fallen to a maximum of 5.

#### ON YOUR TAIL
*Trait, quick action*
The **Aerial** may elect a character within range equal to their speed and within line of sight as a **quick action** to be their target. Then the **Aerial** gains access to the **“Follow up” reaction** until the end of the **Aerial’s** next turn or until it is used.

#### FOLLOW UP
*Reaction, 2 heat (self)*
**Trigger:** The **Aerial** starts their turn whilst **flying**
**Effect:** The **Aerial** flies to a space free and adjacent to target. There must be a path to do so even if the nominated character is no longer within the **Aerial’s** movement range or line of sight. This ignores engagement and does not provoke reactions

#### BOMBING BAY
*Main Launcher, +2/+4/+6*
\[range 10\]\[blast 1\]\[4/5/6 explosive\]
This weapon can only target directly below the **Aerial** and adjacent tiles. Additionally if the **Aerial** interrupts movement to attack with this weapon, it may continue the movement without triggering reactions.

#### FUEL INJECTION BURST
*Trait, Recharge 5+*
When the **Aerial** moves whilst flying, they may move up to an additional 4 spaces but take **heat** equal to half the distance.

#### STRAFE
*Trait*
Every time the Aerial attacks whilst flying, it may take **2 heat** to **fly** 2 spaces after the attack has resolved.

### Fielding Aerial NPC's


## Covert
*Mechs energy and noise profiles exceeds many other vehicles of similar scale, meaning that when trying to go undetected large amounts of training and computer processing power are required to cause a mech to go unnoticed for a small window of time. And even then approximations can be made on their positioning. However some expert mech pilots know the inside and outs of their machine to know how to perfectly mask their energy profile to remain unnoticed for as long as possible.*

### TEMPLATE FEATURES
#### FAST AND LOW
*Trait*
During the **Covert's** turn, the **covert** can **hide** and remain **hidden** whilst in line of sight of hostile characters, and whilst it is not in cover.

#### MINIMUM REQUIRED PREPARATION
*Trait*
When selecting optional systems, the **Covert** can also choose from the **Covert optional systems and traits list**

### COVERT OPTIONAL SYSTEMS AND TRAITS LIST
#### BLIND SPOT
*System, Quick tech, +1/+2/+3*
The **Covert** makes a tech attack against a hostile character within sensors. On a hit, the **Covert** is not to be in line of sight of them until the end of their next turn.

#### CONCEAL
*System, Full action, Recharge 5+*
As a full action the **Covert** may hide. Whilst hidden this way, the **Covert** is not visible to all players and their location is only known by the Game master. This is broken if the **Covert** is no longer **hidden**, performs any action that targets any other character or is directly targeted by an action from an ally or if the **Covert** is involuntarily removed. Whilst **hidden** this way, all actions the **Covert** takes are known to all characters, all characters know if the **Covert** is caught in an area of effect from a hostile character and if a character attempts to search for the **Covert** they automatically learn whether the **Covert** is within **Sensors**, and if they are their distance from the character.

This system replaces **FAST AND LOW**
