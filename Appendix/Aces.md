## An ace up your sleeve
Aces are a new tool to be used by GM's to give NPC's unique powers in narrative play to present them with tools the players can attempt to crack, in a similar manner to how **Bonds** from the field guide to the Karrakin trade barony give players new tools. They're meant to represent the NPC is cut above the rest, gaining new abilities and powers the party may never have seen before, through intense training, years of experience or through the assistance of means beyond science.

The purpose of these Aces is to show some NPCs are more powerful or unique than others, and can't just be "solved" by the same few tricks a party might get accustomed to, yet they are not meant to act as total roadblocks, but new challenges the party needs to think about to get around. An example is the **Hear no evil** ace, this allows an NPC to know whenever they hear a lie. If your party has a silver tongued devil amongst them, this will mean that they have a much harder time dealing with this NPC, but it does not shut down the fact the players can still tell half truths or lies by ommission as an effective method to interact with this character. 

## Using Aces
Any notable NPC can have an Ace, if they are a significant named character it makes sense for them to have one. Some NPCs *can* have access to two Aces if they are more important, and incredibly rarely an NPC can have three.

As a rule of thumb, if it's a significant character they can have one Ace, this can be anything from a Notable mercenary, to a captain guard, a gang boss or a super soldier. Then once per tier of play or roughly three times in a long term camp you may introduce an NPC with two Aces, these can represent Pirate lords, faction leaders or commanders of a powerful corpostate. If you wish to have characters with more Aces than this, you can, but I recommend it should only ever happen once per campaign as a final climactic confrontation.

All aces are either **passive** or **active**, passive aces are permanently active but active aces are one time abilities the NPC may use. Every active ability is assumed to be 1/Mission, however you may also change this depending on the circumstances, some abilities which you think seem to be weaker you may want to be 1/Scene or powerful ones being 1/Campaign. Feel free to mix it up! Make interesting ones, You can make it so the limited uses are equal to arbitrary values that are able to be changed in the world, such as "Once per active generator remaining in the base" as another puzzle for players to solve.

Aces can only be used in a scene where the ace is present, aces are meant to be puzzles that can be actively solved or dealt with in the scene.
## Information and dealing with Aces
Whenever an NPC with an Ace enters a scene, the GM does not reveal that the character has any Ace's until that Ace is **revealed**, however it is up to the GM if that character would wish to unsettle the players and try to show them as more powerful, by revealing they have an Ace but not which ace it is or if it is relevant.

Every **Ace** has a **reveal** condition. Once this reveal condition occurs you must show the all players the Ace, from this point this Ace is public information and everything about it is known to the players including what it does, it's reveal condition, if it's passive, if it's active and how many times an active power may be used. If this NPC is encountered in future scenes, any information previously revealed remains revealed to the players.

If you as the GM think that an NPC will undergo training or methods to gain or change an existing or new ace, you may do so. However if the ace itself has changed, such as changing the frequency of an active ace, only the changed information should be hidden so the players know that something is different. But once revealed again, all information is revealed similar to the first time. NPCs may also change or gain new aces, if an ace is changed clearly state when encountered again that the character does not have the ace it did previously and instead show that they have a non-revealed ace. If a character gains an ace they did not have previously, treat it like any other non-revealed ace. However if a situation reveals the ace where in previous the same actions were taken, clearly state that this is a new ability compared to previous scenes where it would have been relevant.

If a player wishes to learn about an NPC's ace, they can use the **information** reserve or **gather Information** downtime to research and NPC and find out all Ace's the character has, and potentially gaining a relevant **Resource** reserve as a method to get around or **circumvent** the ace.

With sufficient preparation or use of reserves you may **circumvent** an Ace for a scene or longer. For example, with the **Never Alone** ace, the NPC may always call in reinforcements, but if the players wish to pool a bunch of resources to get a local Jammer to shut down local omninet communications for half a minute or if they head off and sabotage their reinforcements vehicles beforehand, the NPC with the ace will not be able to use it for a limited time. If an ace has been circumvented, the character with it will not know this until they try to use it or it should have acted.
